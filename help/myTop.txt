NAME
       top - display processes

SYNOPSIS
       top [Option]

       The traditional switches `-' and whitespace are optional.

DESCRIPTION
       The top program provides a dynamic real-time  view  of  a  running
       system.   It  can  display system summary information as well as a
       list of processes or threads currently being managed by the  Linux
       kernel.   The  types  of  system summary information shown and the
       types, order and size of information displayed for  processes  are
       all  user  configurable and that configuration can be made persis‐
       tent across restarts.

       The program provides a limited interactive interface  for  process
       manipulation  as  well as a much more extensive interface for per‐
       sonal configuration  --  encompassing every aspect of  its  opera‐
       tion.   And while top is referred to throughout this document, you
       are free to name the program anything you wish.   That  new  name,
       possibly  an  alias,  will  then be reflected on top's display and
       used when reading and writing a configuration file.
